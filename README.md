# MCP Server Plugin for Concord

MCP Server Plugin for Concord is a `concord-server` plugin that exposes Concord operations
through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), including process inspection, process log access,
process submission, and CRUD-style operations for Concord organizations, projects,
repositories, secrets, users, inventories, JSON stores, and related resources.

The plugin uses regular Concord authentication and authorization. MCP clients can only access
Concord resources allowed by the Concord user, API key, or session credentials used for the
request.

User-management tools require Concord administrator privileges on the credentials used for
the MCP request.

## Configuration

Optional system properties:

- `concord.mcp.allowedOrigins` - comma-separated origin allowlist.
- `concord.mcp.trustedForwardedProxies` - comma-separated proxy remote addresses whose
  `X-Forwarded-*` headers may be used for origin validation.
- `concord.mcp.maxConcurrentLogStreams` - maximum concurrent streaming log requests, default `8`.
- `concord.mcp.defaultStreamDurationMillis` - default follow duration, default `30000`.
- `concord.mcp.maxStreamDurationMillis` - maximum follow duration, default `60000`.
